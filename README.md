# Excel---Sales-Insight

In this project, I made a sales report using Excel's pivot tables. This report helps businesses figure out the best discounts for customers, makes it easier to negotiate with them, and shows where they could grow in new countries.

I learned a bunch of useful stuff while doing this project:

1. Pivot tables (they're super handy)
2. Power Query (helps clean up data)
3. DAX (basic formulas)
4. Making things look good with Conditional Formatting
5. Making the report look nice
6. Understanding sales numbers

Overall, this project is about giving businesses the tools and info they need to keep an eye on sales, make them better, and find new opportunities for growth. By studying sales data, businesses can find new ways to succeed in a changing market.
